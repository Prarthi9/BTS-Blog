# BTS-Blog
This project was a part of task given by my faculty.
I have only used HTML and CSS while making this semi dynamic blog.
It has basic information about BTS.
It has some navigations to social media accounts of BTS,second memebers' information page and some of the popular songs.
I tried learning HTML and CSS while making this project.
