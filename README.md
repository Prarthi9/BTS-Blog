I created this project 'BTS BLOG' as a part of task given by my faculty.
I have used only HTML and CSS while making this semi dynamic blog.
It has basic BTS information.
It has naviagtion which navigates to different social media accounts of bts,to second members' information page and also there are some navigations for popular songs.
I tried learning HTML and CSS during this project.
